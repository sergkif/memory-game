# 🧠 AI Memory Card Game

A modern memory card matching game where you can compete against an intelligent AI opponent powered by Google's Gemini AI. Test your memory skills against different difficulty levels and see who can find more matching pairs!

Most of the project was generated by GitHub copilot

## ✨ Features

- **AI Opponent**: Play against an intelligent AI powered by Google Gemini with three difficulty levels
- **Customizable Grid**: Choose from different grid sizes (4x4, 6x6, etc.)
- **Real-time Gameplay**: Turn-based gameplay with immediate feedback
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of player vs AI scores
- **Responsive Design**: Built with React and Bootstrap for a smooth experience
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between different visual themes
- **Move History**: Track all moves made by both player and AI

## 🚀 Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Bootstrap 5** for responsive UI components
- **CSS3** for custom styling

### Backend
- **Node.js** with Express.js
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Google Generative AI** (Gemini) for AI opponent
- **CORS** enabled for cross-origin requests

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Start a New Game**: Choose your preferred grid size
2. **Take Turns**: Click on cards to reveal them - you need to find matching pairs
3. **Make Matches**: If two cards match, they stay revealed and you get a point
4. **AI Turn**: The AI will make its moves based on the selected difficulty
5. **Win Condition**: The game ends when all pairs are found - whoever has more matches wins!
