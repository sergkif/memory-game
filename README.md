# 🧠 AI Memory Card Game

A modern memory card matching game where you can compete against an intelligent AI opponent powered by Google's Gemini AI. Test your memory skills against different difficulty levels and see who can find more matching pairs!

Most of the project was generated by GitHub copilot

## ✨ Features

- **AI Opponent**: Play against an intelligent AI powered by Google Gemini with three difficulty levels
- **Customizable Grid**: Choose from different grid sizes (4x4, 6x6, etc.)
- **Real-time Gameplay**: Turn-based gameplay with immediate feedback
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of player vs AI scores
- **Responsive Design**: Built with React and Bootstrap for a smooth experience
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between different visual themes
- **Move History**: Track all moves made by both player and AI

## 🚀 Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Bootstrap 5** for responsive UI components
- **CSS3** for custom styling

### Backend
- **Node.js** with Express.js
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Google Generative AI** (Gemini) for AI opponent
- **CORS** enabled for cross-origin requests

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Start a New Game**: Choose your preferred grid size
2. **Take Turns**: Click on cards to reveal them - you need to find matching pairs
3. **Make Matches**: If two cards match, they stay revealed and you get a point
4. **AI Turn**: The AI will make its moves based on the selected difficulty
5. **Win Condition**: The game ends when all pairs are found - whoever has more matches wins!

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Google Gemini API key

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd memory-game
```

2. **Install all dependencies (monorepo setup)**
```bash
npm run install:all
```

3. **Set up environment variables**
Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
PORT=3001
```

### Development

1. **Start both frontend and backend in development mode**

Option A - In separate terminals:
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
npm run dev:backend

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
npm run dev:frontend
```

Option B - Individual setup (original method):
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

# Frontend (in another terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 AI Difficulty Levels

- **Easy**: Makes random or simple moves
- **Medium**: Uses basic strategy and memory
- **Hard**: Advanced strategy with optimal move planning

## 🔧 Available Scripts

### Frontend
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

### Backend
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm start` - Start production server

## 🌐 API Endpoints

- `POST /api/flip` - Flip a card
- `POST /api/ai-move` - Get AI move
- `POST /api/reset` - Reset unmatched cards

## 🚀 Deployment

This project is configured for monorepo deployment on Vercel from the root directory:

### Option 1: Deploy from Root (Recommended)

1. **Connect Repository**: Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. **Root Directory**: Set the root directory to `.` (current directory)  
3. **Build Command**: Leave as default (Vercel will use the build configuration from `vercel.json`)
4. **Output Directory**: Leave as default (configured in `vercel.json` as `frontend/dist`)
5. **Environment Variables**: Set the following in Vercel dashboard:
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here`
6. **Deploy**: Click deploy - Vercel will handle both frontend and backend

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

1. **Build the project**:
```bash
npm run install:all
npm run build
```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### Environment Variables for Production

In your Vercel project settings, add:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key

### Vercel Configuration

The project includes a `vercel.json` configuration that:
- Builds the frontend using `@vercel/static-build` 
- Deploys the backend as serverless functions using `@vercel/node`
- Routes API calls to `/api/*` to the backend
- Serves the frontend for all other routes
- Outputs the built frontend to `frontend/dist`
